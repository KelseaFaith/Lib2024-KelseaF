    <section>  <h2> In my years of customer service...  </h2>   </section> <!-- This will be a title for this section -->

    <section>  <p> When I first started working with the public I could hear a shake or tremble in my voice. I could hear myself being new and uncomfortable and shy. This was mostly when a customer would be complaining or impatient, I would have a hard time stabilizing my emotions in these awkward/ difficult moments. After a few years of customer service jobs, I became a supervisor and manager of multiple customer service based facilities, now confidently helping customers walk away happy after coming in upset.  
My personal tip: People often deescalate when they are genuinely heard and validated. Repeating a bit of why what they are experiencing could be frustrating from your own point of view but can often help them feel understood. Then genuinely care to make up for the issue with a solution, like a discount or a free donut to put a smile on their face and send them along. Ensuring their issue feels properly cared about will also have you feeling like you've genuinely had a positive impact on their day. This type of experience builds your confidence in how to negotiate and apologize without accepting blame on you, but rather focusing on making the situation better for the upset person. I found these links with great information on confidence and difficult customer situations.
